    Initial buyer tests of Serve interactions
        Part one: In-house testing
            Background: Built out Buyer App into a clickable prototype via Figma to test flow before implementation by HQ. 
                - Used Figma Mirroring to run through prototype with co-workers on teams unfamiliar with the user flow
                - Any pain points or usability/design suggestions were shared with my team and implemented if in scope
                - Final flow was sent to HQ to be built out and integrated into the Buyer App
         [Include the App flow I made here]

            Recruitment: Friends & Family, In-org Participants
            Context: 
                Setup: I wrote protocol, moderator's guide for a semi-structured interview, used the Beta app for prerelease, staged testing
                Research Team: moderator, emotecontroller and notetaker, wizard facilitating Staging order experience 
                

        Part two: LA Buyer testing
            Recruitment: External recruitment from a WeWork in LA 
            Setup: I wrote protocol, moderator's guide for a semi-structured interview, used the production app
                - Protocol: 
                    1. Participant places order
                    2. Moderator performs semi-structured interview throughout the session
                    3. A first generation of Serve rovers "delivers" the participant's order
