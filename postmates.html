            <h2>Serve, by Postmates</h2>
            <p>Serve is an autonomous sidewalk delivery robot designed to take short distance, low-profit deliveries. Through the use of lidar and other sensors, Serve is able to safely and intelligently navigate busy sidewalks, while keeping orders secure in it’s locked cargo bin.</p>
            <h3>Product Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Friendly and approachable</li>
                <li>Able to communicate intent</li>
                <li>People should feel safe around it</li>
                <li>Secure and hygenic cargo</li>
                <li>Recognizable, not just another robot</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>My role as a Researcher and Designer</h3>
            <p>As part of the Design Team, I work on various design projects and conduct user experience research. With my strong background in research, much of the work I have done has been performing studies with our various users. This research closely ties into the design projects that I have worked on and informs the usability decisions made with the team. </p>

                <h2>Buyer Experience Research</h2>
                <p>Recieving a delivery from Serve is an expereince entirely different from that of a traditional Postmate, so we designed an experience that would seamlessly guide our users through the experience.  </p>

                <h3>Research Challenges</h3>
                <p>At the beginning of this research study, the user experience had yet to be built out. The most we had were app screens in Figma and a backend infrastructure for conducting jobs. In order to pull these pieces together into a comprehensive user experience, I had to get crafty. I wizarded the user experience by manually progressing the app flow via CLI and triggering expressions on the robot. I had very little experience with the software at the beginning of this study, but by the end I knew the system inside and out!

                <h2>Cargo Research and Design</h2>
                <p>Customers ordering from the Postmates app tend to all have at least one thing in common, they want their food to arrive as if the chef just placed it on their kitchen table. While Serve is no on-the-go chef, we have taken care to design a safe and secure cargo space that will ensure an order arrives in the best condition possible. </p>

                    <h3>Establishing the Market</h3>
                    <p>To do this, we analyzed the most common order compositions fulfilled by Postmates and created a list of requirements to accommodate them all.</p>

                    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>I created a few potential configurations via a 3D graphics software. Once we decided on the four versions we wanted to test, I created foam core prototypes for user testing.</p>

            <div>
                <div>
                    <h3>User Testing</h3>
                    <p>We brought our foam core prototypes to a handful of merchants for testing. They provided us with essential feedback that led to my final design.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>The Final Design</h3>
                    <p>I refined the design based on our research findings. We settled on a single configuration that provides plenty of space for large orders, holds up to two drinks, and accomodates large pizzas.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Design Challenges</h3>
                <p>The design requirements for the cargo included not only the accomodation of our most common orders types, but also considerations for eurgonomics and accessibility. I found that one of the best ways to visualize and modify these designs was by building a 3D model of it. With the help of a Product Designer on the team, I learned to use 3D modeling software that allowed me to iterate and ideate with ease.</p>

                <h2>Pilot Experience Research</h2>
                <p>Pilots spend hours a day attending to many key aspects of a delivery, including order information, dropoff deadlines, customer support, and route optimization. It is essential that we design a UI that makes doing their job easy and sustainable. To do this, we have to take the following into consideration.</p>

                <h3>Driving Serve</h3>
                <p>Sometimes autonmous vehicles need help, so Pilots need to have the ability to take control of a Serve at a moment’s notice.</p>

            <div>
                <img src="#">
                <h3>Managing a Delivery</h3>
                <p>Pilots oversee orders as they travel from Merchant to Buyer, ensuring that everything arrives in tip-top shape.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="#">
                <h3>Collecting Data</h3>
                <p>Our team is constantly working to improve Serve’s systems, so Pilots will often collect data and metrics to help in this effort.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Design and Research Challenges</h3>
                <p>Pilots attend to a number of systems at once, which results in a high cognitive load. This load can lead to stress, burnout, mistakes, and more. Designing a system that contain all the necessary information in a way that is quick to understand is essential. The Pilot UI has gone through many iterations, often in reaction to the addition or removeal of features. Consistent research is the only way to ensure that these changes don’t negatively impact pilot performance.</p>

                    <p>
                      Hi, there! Thanks for checking out my site!
                      I am currently working on an autonomous delivery robot at Postmates X.

                    <p>
                      As a bit of a UX generalist, I have a passion for developing products that are based in a deep understanding of how people will interact with it and use it. Creating a physical product or user interface that is easy to use and brings joy to people’s lives is my goal.
