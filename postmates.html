                        <p>The design requirements for the cargo included not only the accomodation of our most common orders types, but also considerations for eurgonomics and accessibility. I found that one of the best ways to visualize and modify these designs was by building a 3D model of it. With the help of a Product Designer on the team, I learned to use 3D modeling software that allowed me to iterate and ideate with ease.</p>

                    <p>At the beginning of this research study, the user experience had yet to be built out. The most we had were app screens in Figma and a backend infrastructure for conducting jobs. In order to pull these pieces together into a comprehensive user experience, I had to get crafty. I wizarded the user experience by manually progressing the app flow via CLI and triggering expressions on the robot. I had very little experience with the software at the beginning of this study, but by the end I knew the system inside and out!

        <h2>Pilot Experience Research</h2>
        <p>Pilots spend hours a day attending to many key aspects of a delivery, including order information, dropoff deadlines, customer support, and route optimization. It is essential that we design a UI that makes doing their job easy and sustainable. To do this, we have to take the following into consideration.</p>

            <h3>Driving Serve</h3>
            <p>Sometimes autonmous vehicles need help, so Pilots need to have the ability to take control of a Serve at a momentâ€™s notice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="white_info_card">

            <h3>Deliveries</h3>
            <p>Pilots oversee orders as they travel from Merchant to Buyer, ensuring that everything arrives in tip-top shape.</p>

            <h3>Collecting Data</h3>
            <p>Our team is constantly working to improve Serveâ€™s systems, so Pilots will often collect data and metrics to help in this effort.</p>

        <h3>Design and Research Challenges</h3>
        <p>Pilots attend to a number of systems at once, which results in a high cognitive load. This load can lead to stress, burnout, mistakes, and more. Designing a system that contains all the necessary information in a way that is quick to understand is essential. The Pilot UI has gone through many iterations, often in reaction to the addition or removeal of features. Consistent research is the only way to ensure that these changes donâ€™t negatively impact pilot performance.</p>
