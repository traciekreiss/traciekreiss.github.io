                        <p>SEO is essential for bringing in the traffic necessary to create the conversion and inquiry volume necessary to make the vendor marketplace profitable. Advertising is one of the biggest experiences at most companies, with each click coming from google costing money. It was my job to create several SEO solutions for the vendor marketplace, all of which greatly increased traffic and overall engagement from users.</p>

                        <p>A core aspect of the couple’s experience on Zola’s vendor marketplace is the action of searching for a vendor. While very similar to the average e-commerce experience, the vendor search is far more complex and nuanced. With 10+ vendor categories, each with a unique set of price ranges, services, accommodations, and badges, it’s a huge challenge to help the user understand at a glance why they would want to book one florist over another.</p>

                        <p>Zola’s inquiry quality is one of the things that makes it stand apart from its competitors. This means ensuring that each inquiry coming into a vendor’s inbox is both from a real couple and contains the vital information needed to understand if this is the right type of client for their business. This requires couples to provide style and service preferences, budgets, dates, and a customized message to the vendor, which is a lot of information to gather in one quiz. By looking at user drop-off and through user testing, we were able to identify keys areas that created too much friction for couples during the inquiry process. Through optimizations and new features, we were able to greatly increase inquiry conversion and volume.</p>

As the product grew with new features and tools, it became clear that a dashboard was an essential element that vendors wanted and needed.

This is where new business comes to them, and where Zola makes their money. Creating an experience with robust and easy to digest inquiries from couples was essential to not only encouraging vendors to use the platform, but also to entice them to connect with the couple inquiring about their services. Through rounds of user testing, interviews with real vendors, and the monitoring of engagement metrics, I was able to implement optimizations that would improve inquiry conversion and to create an inbox experience that vendors would love. </p>

It became my responsibility to monitor, maintain, and publish this library, which was ever-changing with each new project, tool, and feature we created.
