                    <p>At the beginning of this research study, the user experience had yet to be built out. The most we had were app screens in Figma and a backend infrastructure for conducting jobs. In order to pull these pieces together into a comprehensive user experience, I had to get crafty. I wizarded the user experience by manually progressing the app flow via CLI and triggering expressions on the robot. I had very little experience with the software at the beginning of this study, but by the end I knew the system inside and out!

I found that one of the best ways to visualize and modify these designs was by building a 3D model of it. With the help of a Product Designer on the team, I learned to use 3D modeling software that allowed me to iterate and ideate with ease.</p>

Designing a system that contain all the necessary information in a way that is quick to understand is essential. The Pilot UI has gone through many iterations, often in reaction to the addition or removeal of features. Consistent research is the only way to ensure that these changes don’t negatively impact pilot performance.</p>

                    <p>
                      Hi, there! Thanks for checking out my site!
                      I am currently working on an autonomous delivery robot at Postmates X.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As a bit of a UX generalist, I have a passion for developing products that are based in a deep understanding of how people will interact with it and use it. Creating a physical product or user interface that is easy to use and brings joy to people’s lives is my goal. 
                    </p>
