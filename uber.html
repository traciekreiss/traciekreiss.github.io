                    <p>With loyal customers taking rides every day, Uber decided it was about time to reward them. They did this by creating a rewards system that would bring unique benefits to their users for every dollar spent.</p>

                        <p>We conducted tests on features as they were developed and released into the Beta App. It was essential that we look out for known potenital issues, such as failed geofences or missing discounts, as well as identify other unforeseen bugs.</p>

                    <p>
                      Hi, there! Thanks for checking out my site!
                      I am currently working on an autonomous delivery robot at Postmates X.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As a bit of a UX generalist, I have a passion for developing products that are based in a deep understanding of how people will interact with it and use it. Creating a physical product or user interface that is easy to use and brings joy to people’s lives is my goal. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you’re interested in designing and testing a user centered product,  let’s get in touch!
